# Program-to-reveal-IP-address-on-a-machine
My program prints a command to automate the retrieval of an IP address from a desired machine or localhost


For clarifaction on this program and its purpose: 

The IP address method obtains the selected server IP address information. It then displays the type of address family supported by the server and its IP address in standard and byte format. We are getting all associated server related information. In this program instance, we are using the For loop on the Address List and it is used to print the type of address family supported by the server. This will reveal a desired PC, can be sent or injected anywhere where the code would be distributed into the server or client side, to obtain this IP address.
